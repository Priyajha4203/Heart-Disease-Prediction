# Heart-Disease-Prediction

**Objective :**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease. It will utilize a binary classification approach, where the model will analyze various patient-related features and categorize them as either having heart disease (positive) or not (negative).

There are two classes: 
   -> Heart Disease Present(target=1)
   -> Heart Disease not present(target=0)

   

**Data Description :**

• age: Age in years

• sex: 1 = male, 0 = female

• cp: Chest pain type

      • Value 1: typical angina
      
      • Value 2: atypical angina
      
      • Value 3: non-anginal pain
      
      • Value 4: asymptomatic
      
• trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

• chol: serum cholesterol in mg/dl

• fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)

• restecg:Resting electrocardiographic results

• thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

• exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

• oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

• slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment

• ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy

• thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect

• target: 1 = Heart disease present, 0 = Heart disease not present
